# `@modern-js/app-tools-extensions`

Fork-owned UltraModern.js app tooling for Cloudflare Worker delivery, output verification, and release-envelope identity enforcement.

The package is composed into upstream app-tools through existing deploy/plugin extension seams. It must not depend on `@modern-js/app-tools`.

## Private origins and module-scope bindings

Private origins behind a Cloudflare Tunnel are first-class on
`deploy.worker.vpcServices` (`{ binding, serviceId, prefix? }`). Modern.js
writes them to `wrangler.json` as `vpc_services` (top level and every
`wrangler.env.<name>`, because Wrangler bindings are not inherited), and a
binding with `prefix`
is dispatched with `env[binding].fetch(request)` like a prefixed
`deploy.worker.services` entry. A VPC binding name may not reuse any other
Worker binding: any `binding` field or array-entry `name` in the Wrangler
config (`ASSETS`, services, D1, KV, Hyperdrive, queue producers, Durable
Objects, `send_email`, rate limits, …), including each `wrangler.env.<name>`'s
own bindings, or a `vars` key. A VPC prefix must be a decoded path starting with `/` that URL parsing keeps unchanged (no query, fragment,
`.` or `..` segments), and may not overlap, even as a percent-encoded alias, the
Effect BFF prefix or any other routed prefix (the worker decodes the request
path, dispatches the BFF first, matches path segments and takes the first
match),
and the typed option excludes a raw `wrangler.vpc_services`.

Code that needs a binding outside the request handler, such as a Hyperdrive
connection string or a VPC fetcher, imports `env` from `cloudflare:workers`,
which worker bundles externalize like `cloudflare:sockets`.
